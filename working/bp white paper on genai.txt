AI encompasses a broad range of applications and technologies designed to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. AI learns and adapts through data analysis and pattern recognition, enabling it to mimic human behavior in performing specific tasks using pre-defined rules and algorithms. Examples of common AI include machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.

# Generative AI

Generative AI, or gen AI, represents a breakthrough in AI because of its ability to create and produce new or novel content rather than analyzing, classifying and regurgitating existing data. It works in various forms including text, code, imagery, processes and sound, which can be used to improve productivity in various areas ranging from customer service and marketing to music and the visual arts.

One of the more popular types of generative AI is Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs understand and generate natural language and are used in various applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation and language translation. Given their ability to generate coherent, informative content with context, LLMs can serve as powerful automation support tools. ChatGPT is an LLM, for example.

The positive impact (of LLMs) on human creativity and productivity will be massive because language tasks account for 62% of the total time employees work, and 65% of that time can be transformed into more productive activity through augmentation and automation.
